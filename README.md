<h1>Food Safety Analysis in Sub-Saharan Africa</h1>

### [Business Analytics Competition - 3rd Place Winner](https://manhattan.edu/academics/schools-and-departments/school-of-business/business-analytics-competition/previous/2023-bac.php)

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
This project investigates food safety conditions in Sub-Saharan Africa by analyzing key determinants and predicting future trends. By leveraging machine learning models, we assess factors influencing food safety and identify potential solutions to mitigate foodborne illnesses. The project introduces a "Food Safety Index" that quantifies food safety conditions across different countries and clusters them based on similar attributes. Using time-series machine learning models, we predict food safety trends and propose policy interventions.

<h2>Program Walk-Through</h2>

<h3>1. Data Processing</h3>
- Created a composite Food Safety Index based on key indicators like child malnutrition, neonatal mortality rate, and dietary energy supply.<br />
- Clustered countries using TimeSeriesKMeans to group similar food safety conditions.<br />
- Cleaned missing data based on cluster characteristics.<br />

<h3>2. Analytical and Prediction Models</h3>
- Variable Importance Analysis: Identified the most influential factors affecting food safety using Random Forest, Lasso, and Ridge Regression.<br />
- Prediction Model: Used LSTM  to predict food safety trends for 2023.<br />

<h3>3. Model Validation and Recommendations</h3>
- Training and Testing Data: Models were trained on data from 2000‚Äì2019 and validated using 2020 data.<br />
- Validation Metric: RMSE was used to evaluate model accuracy.<br />
- Policy Recommendations:Based on analysis, the study suggests investing in infrastructure (clean water, food storage, sanitation) and public awareness campaigns.<br />

<h3>4. Insights</h3>
- Food Safety Clusters: Countries were categorized into four clusters based on economic, environmental, and governance factors.<br />
- Top 5 Key Factors Influencing Food Safety: Basic Drinking Water, Clean Fuels Access, GDP per Capita, Food Production Index, Cereal Yield <br />
- Prediction Results: The LSTM model forecasts food safety deterioration in some regions, highlighting the need for urgent intervention.<br />
